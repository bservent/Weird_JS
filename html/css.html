            <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets and is used to make web pages more attractive looking. This language sets certain styles via declarations with selectors to the respective html tags that it is correlated with. It is a cascading language meaning the flow is from top to bottom for style preferences. It makes things so much easier because it is reusable code that can be implemented across multiple html pages. It also looks way better than HTML styling and is easily read in browsers so it won't bog down a page. Lastly it can be stored in the cache and therefor is viewable offline</p>
